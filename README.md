# Test Design Techniques Workshop Series

Welcome to the Test Design Techniques Workshop Series! 🎉 In this series, we'll explore three powerful test design techniques that will take your testing skills to the next level. Get ready to dive into the world of [Equivalence Partitioning](./Equivalence_Partitioning.md), [Boundary Value Analysis](Boundary_Value_Analysis.md), and [Decision Table Testing](./Decision_Table.md)!

## Workshop 1: Equivalence Partitioning 🍪

In the first workshop, we'll learn how to use Equivalence Partitioning to divide the input domain into classes and conquer the testing realm. You'll discover how to identify valid and invalid equivalence classes, reduce the number of test cases, and find those sneaky defects hiding in the shadows.

## Workshop 2: Boundary Value Analysis 🌋

The second workshop will take you on a thrilling adventure into the world of Boundary Value Analysis. We'll explore the edges of input domains, push the boundaries, and uncover defects that lurk in the corners. Get ready to become a master of edge case testing and ensure your system can handle anything thrown its way!

## Workshop 3: Decision Table Testing 🗺️

In the final workshop, we'll embark on a quest to create decision tables that guide us through complex business rules and logic. You'll learn how to organize conditions and actions, cover all possible combinations, and design comprehensive test cases. By the end of this workshop, you'll be a decision table wizard, ready to tackle any testing challenge!

## Each Challenge

Each challenge is in it's own README.md, and near the bottom a set of model answers has been included for you to compare with and check you're on the right track.

## Prerequisites

To make the most out of these workshops, you should have a basic understanding of software testing concepts and a passion for learning new techniques. Bring your curiosity, creativity, and a willingness to think outside the box!
